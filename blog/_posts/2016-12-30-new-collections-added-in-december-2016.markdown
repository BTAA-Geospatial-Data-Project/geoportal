Approximately 350 records were added to the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal during December of 2016, bringing the total to over 4,000.

## State of Illinois
The **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign** submitted 129 records from the [Illinois Natural Resources Geospatial Data Clearinghouse](https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/frontpage). These datasets encompass the topics of Climate, Elevation, Imagery, Geology, Infrastructure, Landcover, Hydrology, and Reference for the state of Illinois.

## Counties in Wisconsin & Minnesota
The **University of Wisconsin Madison** and the **University of Minnesota** also submitted new records, primarily from county governments.  These records represent the movement towards Open Data that has been growing rapidly in these two states, where many of the county and municipal governments have made their geospatial data publicly and freely available.  Examples of datasets from these collections include road networks, parcels, address points, and zoning.


### Wisconsin
The following Wisconsin Counties have metadata records in the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal:  Bayfield, Brown, Calumet, Dodge, Douglas, Fond du Lac, Green, Green Lake, Manitowoc, Marathon, Milwaukee, Oneida, Outagamie, Ozaukee, Racine, Sauk, St. Croix, Trempealeau, Waukesha, Waupaca, and Wood.  _Note: These records can also be found on [GeoData@Wisconsin](http://maps.sco.wisc.edu/opengeoportal/), which is developed and maintained by UW-Madison Geography Department's Robinson Map Library and State Cartographer's Office._

### Minnesota
For the state of Minnesota, Geoffrey Moss of MetroGIS has created a map showing all of the counties with open data.  Most of these can be found within the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal either under the collection [titled Minnesota Geospatial Commons](https://geo.btaa.org/?_=1483133299129&f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Minnesota+Geospatial+Commons) or as the county name itself.  _Note: To search the Minnesota Geospatial Commons directly, [click here](https://gisdata.mn.gov/)._

## Digitized / Scanned Maps
We added over 400 scanned map records to the geoportal during January 2017. These maps are part of the following university library collections:

- [John R. Borchert Map Library](https://geo.btaa.org/?_=1485536235299&f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=John+R.+Borchert+Map+Library)
- [Iowa Counties Historic Atlases](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Iowa+Counties+Historic+Atlases)
- [Michigan State University Map Library](https://geo.btaa.org/?_=1485536235300&f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Michigan+State+University+Map+Library)
- [University of Maryland Digital Collections](https://geo.btaa.org/?_=1485536235300&f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=University+of+Maryland+Digital+Collections)
- [Indiana Historic Maps](https://geo.btaa.org/?_=1485536235301&f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Indiana+Historic+Maps)
- [Clark Library Map Collections](https://geo.btaa.org/?_=1485536235301&f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Clark+Library+Map+Collections)



Each scanned map has been spatially referenced with the addition of bounding box coordinates.  This enables the use of the basemap search inset to find items by location.  Here are two techniques for spatial searching:


### Zoom and pan the map to areas of interest.  
The search results will automatically update to show just the items that fall within the region shown on the basemap search window.

### Hover over items in the search results list.  
This will display the associated bounding box as a blue overlay in the basemap search window.

## Minnesota Legislative GIS Resources
Looking to make political maps for the state of Minnesota?  We added 24 records for shapefiles available from the [Minnesota Legislative Coordinating Commission - Geospatial Information (LCC-GIS)](https://geo.btaa.org/?_=1485536235301&f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Clark+Library+Map+Collections).  This group includes election results from 2008-2016, and the legislative district boundaries from 1994, 2002, and 2012.

## Minor Interface Changes
### Browse all records
Users can now more easily browse all records by clicking on the search button on the homepage without entering text in the search box.

### New Facet Order
The left hand facets on the search results page have also been reordered with Place and Data Type at the top.  This change is the result of usability tests that indicated these would be the most helpful categories for filtering records.

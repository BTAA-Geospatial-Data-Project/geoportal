## New records
### Washington, D.C.
During May 2017, [805 new GIS records from Washington, D.C.’s Open Data Portal](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=District+of+Columbia+Open+Data&search_field=all_fields) were added to our geoportal.  Washington, D.C. has published an extensive collection of geospatial datasets with several interesting categories of datasets, including ongoing public services ([abandoned vehicles](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/485134cd-0a52-46b2-97c3-bf86cb60423d), [dead animal pickup](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/b7d03a63-e7a2-4185-9141-9f68ef070ee3)), cultural analyses ([artist density](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/e829c8d2-8362-446c-b04f-32e83eaee98e), [memorials](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/15673154-69f9-4410-9d64-d741c27a771d)), and over [200 records related to Vision Zero](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdc_subject_sm%5D%5B%5D=Vision+Zero&search_field=all_fields), the city’s plan to eliminate traffic fatalities.

## Geospatial Metadata Workshop
The month of May also brought the beginning of our metadata outreach efforts in the form of a 3 hour session presented at the Minnesota GIS/LIS Spring Workshops.  Karen Majewicz and Melinda Kernik led the workshop, which covered the importance of metadata, standards and tools, techniques for batch generating technical and administrative elements, and a discussion of what makes good descriptive metadata.
